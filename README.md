# Sarcasm detection using BERT

This project uses NLP techniques to classify if tweets are sarcastic or not. BERT is used to train the model and arrive at the predictions.

### How to run the code

1.  The executable code resides in the file *Sentiment_Analysis_with_BERT.ipynb*. This code needs to be directly executed from Google Colab. Click on the button below to open the file in Colab.

2.  Once in Colab, the code needs to run on a GPU. From Colab, navigate to **Edit> Notebook Settings**. Select **GPU** from the *Hardware accelerator* dropdown

3.  The notebook can be executed by executing all the code blocks in order by clicking on the black 'Play' button at the top of each block.

4.  In the end, all the predictions are stored in *answer.txt* in the *output* folder in the workspace.
